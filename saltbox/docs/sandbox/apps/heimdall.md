# Heimdall

## What is it?

[Heimdall](https://heimdall.site/) is a way to organise all those links to your most used web sites and web applications in a simple way. Simplicity is the key to Heimdall. Why not use it as your browser start page? It even has the ability to include a search bar using either Google, Bing or DuckDuckGo.
