## Does Saltbox support encrypted data on the cloud?

In short, no. Saltbox does not come with encryption support out-of-box.

## Why does Saltbox not support encryption data on the cloud?

While there are pro's and cons for using either encrypted or unencrypted data on cloud services, we've decided to not deal with encryption for the out of box setup.

However, since Saltbox uses Rclone VFS to mount cloud data, you can tweak the mounts and remotes to do this yourself. But doing so comes with no support/help from us.
