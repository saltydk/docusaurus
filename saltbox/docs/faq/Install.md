## Ansible Tags

### Multiple Tags

Run multiple tags together by separating them with commas, no spaces. Quotes are optional. Order is not important.

Use this to install containers or roles that are not included in "default" install types.  

Example:

```
sb install core,emby,sonarr,radarr,nzbget,nzbhydra2
```

### Skip Tags

Skip tags you dont want to run by listing them with `--skip-tags` and separated by commas. Quotes are optional. Order is not important.

Use this to skip containers or roles that are included in the "default" install types. 

Example:

```
sb install saltbox --skip-tags rutorrent,jackett
```

_Note: But be careful on what you skip, as some things are needed by Saltbox to function properly._

### Merging Tags and Skip-Tags

You can even merge `--tags` and `--skip-tags` into one command. Order is not important (e.g. skip tags can come before tags). 

Example:

```
sb install core,emby,sonarr,radarr,nzbget,nzbhydra2 --skip-tags rutorrent,jackett
```

Can also be used along with one of the "default" tags (e.g. `saltbox`).

Example:

```
sb install saltbox,sabnzbd --skip-tags rutorrent,jackett
```

### Persistent Skip Tags

You can "permanently" skip tags by adding the following lines to `/srv/git/saltbox/ansible.cfg`.

Format: 

```ini
[tags]
skip = TAG1,TAG2,etc
```
And then continue to install with the normal `--tags` command. 

Example:

```
cat /srv/git/saltbox/ansible.cfg
```

```ini
[tags]
skip = rutorrent,jackett
```

```
sb install saltbox,sabnzbd
```

In this example, the Saltbox installer will install with all the default items and sabnzbd, but will not install rutorrent and jackett.

## 403 Client Error: Forbidden: endpoint with name \<container name\> already exists in network \<network name\>

Example:

```
fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "msg": "Error starting container 6fb60d4cdabe938986042e06ef482012a1d85a66a099d861f08062d8262c2ef7: 403 Client Error: Forbidden (\"{\"message\":\"endpoint with name jackett already exists in network bridge\"}\")"}
    to retry, use: --limit @/home/seed/saltbox/saltbox.retry
PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=1
```

You have a remnant of the container in the Docker's network.

You can verify with the command below (replace `<network name>` and `<container name>` is replaced with the network name and container name mentioned in the error, respectively):
```
docker inspect network <network name> | grep <container name>
```

To remove the remnant, run this command and try again:

```
docker network disconnect -f <network name> <container name>
```


## 500 Server Error: Internal Server Error: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint \<container name\> bind for 0.0.0.0:\<port number\> failed: port is already allocated

```
sudo service docker stop
sudo service docker start
```
