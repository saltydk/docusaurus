The default Cloudplow setup uploads to the `google` remote using a single account, which limits you to 750GB/day of upload.

To utilize rotating service accounts to upload more than this, you'll need to configure cloudplow to upload to the individual shared drives.

If you used the [scripted rclone method](rclone-manual.md), there is a script in the sb_gd repo that will make the required modifications to the cloudplow config.

NOTE: This script is assuming that your service account file are in `/opt/sa/all`, which is where the [scripted rclone method](rclone-manual.md) puts them.

The script is also assuming a totally stock Cloudplow `config.json` as it comes from the original saltbox install.  If you have added `remote`s or `uploader`s it will fail with an error.

This script is only useful if you have used the [scripted rclone method](rclone-manual.md).

AGAIN: This script is **only useful if you have used the [scripted rclone method](rclone-manual.md).**

This script is going to load the config from the last script in that process, and if it finds that config unmodified [specifically the prefix found in the config, which you create as part of that process] it will exit with a message to that effect.  There is no point in trying to circumvent this, since it is going to look for rclone remotes with specific names based on that prefix, which point at shared drives that it created with that prefix, etc.

You will have to have completed `sb install saltbox` before using this script.

1. Run the script

    ```
    cd /opt/sb_gd
    source sb_gd/bin/activate
    python sb_cp.py
    ```

    If that doesn't work, update to the latest version of the files from the repo with `git pull` and try again.

2. Restart the cloudplow service:

    ```
    sudo systemctl restart cloudplow
    ```
